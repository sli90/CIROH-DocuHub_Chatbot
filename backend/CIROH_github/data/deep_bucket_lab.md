# Project Title: **deep_bucket_lab**

## Project Objective  
**DeepBucketLab** is an interactive, hands-on educational tool designed to introduce students in civil engineering and Earth science disciplines to neural network-based modeling. The project emphasizes hydrological processes, aiming to fill the educational gap in formal neural network training for hydrology at upper-division and graduate levels.

## Core Functionalities  
- Interactive learning through hands-on modeling exercises.  
- Focused on understanding hydrological processes using modern neural network models.  
- Enables practical training and evaluation of neural network models for hydrological applications.  
- Fully accessible via Binder for browser-based execution without local setup.  
- Includes advanced code modules for data generation, modeling, validation, and visualization.  
- Provides structured directories for modular experimentation, configuration, and reproducibility.  

## Technical Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Not specified  
- **Environment Management:** Conda (environment.yml)  
- **Execution Interfaces:** Jupyter Notebook, Command Line
