# Project Title: **CAMELS_data_sample**

## Project Objective  
The **CAMELS_data_sample** repository provides sample data for learning to use the CAMELS dataset with various modeling platforms. It is designed solely for educational and demonstration purposes and is not intended for research or operational use.

## Core Functionalities  
- Includes **sample basins** to replicate the original CAMELS 2014 directory structure.  
- Provides **streamflow** and **forcing files** organized under directories numbered 01–18, with one representative basin per directory.  
- Contains **sample years 1993–2013** to reduce file size and allow GitHub hosting.  
- Offers a simplified dataset for testing neural hydrology or similar modeling workflows.  

## Technical Stack  
- **Languages:** Not specified.  
- **Dependencies:** Not specified.  
- **Data Source:** Full CAMELS dataset available from [UCAR](https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels).  

## Setup and Usage  
- The repository is pre-structured for immediate use with modeling platforms compatible with CAMELS data.  
- To access complete datasets, users should retrieve the full CAMELS data from UCAR.  

## Project Context & Domain  
- **Domain:** Hydrology / Data Modeling / Machine Learning.  
- **Affiliation:** Not specified.  
- **Purpose:** Provide a small, easy-to-access version of the CAMELS dataset for testing and learning workflows.  

## Input / Output  
**Input:** Not specified.  
**Output:** Sample CAMELS-format data files representing basins and years for hydrological modeling.  

## Citation Guidelines  
Do **not** cite this repository. Users should cite the full CAMELS dataset or CARAVAN instead.
