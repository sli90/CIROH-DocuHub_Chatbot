# Project Title: **nrds-onprem**

## Project Objective  
**nrds-onprem** serves as the **AWI Open Source Project Template** maintained by the **Alabama Water Institute (AWI)**. It provides a standardized foundation for new open-source repositories, ensuring consistent documentation, contribution workflows, version control practices, and security compliance across CIROH and AWI software projects. Rather than functioning as an application, this repository acts as a **meta-template** for initializing and structuring new development projects.

## Core Functionalities  
- Establishes a complete repository skeleton with standardized documentation files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `INSTALL.md`).  
- Includes GitHub workflow templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) for consistent collaboration.  
- Defines version control configurations (`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`) that enforce repository hygiene and prevent merge conflicts in `CHANGELOG.md`.  
- Provides a legal framework via the MIT License for open collaboration and redistribution.  
- Enforces documentation, quality assurance, and security standards for all derivative projects.  
- Designed to be instantiated using GitHub’s template feature or by cloning and customizing manually.

## Technical Stack  
- **Languages/Frameworks:** Not language-specific (intended for Python/Django backends and JavaScript/Node.js frontends).  
- **Tools/Dependencies:** GitHub Actions, Markdown-based documentation, Git version control.  
- **Hosting/Runtime:** GitHub (template repository).  

## Setup and Usage  
1. **Initialize a new project** by selecting this repository as a GitHub template or cloning it manually.  
2. **Replace placeholder content** in `README.md` and add any dependencies to the Credits section.  
3. **Delete template instructions** from the README once customized.  
4. **Keep the README current** as the first point of user engagement.  
5. Optional files like `INSTALL.md` provide installation examples for derived projects.

## Project Context & Domain  
- **Domain:** Software Engineering / Repository Management / Documentation Framework.  
- **Affiliation:** Alabama Water Institute (AWI) and CIROH (Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology).  
- **Purpose:** To enforce best practices in project documentation, contribution, and compliance across AWI- and CIROH-affiliated software projects, ensuring maintainability and interoperability.

## Input / Output  
**Input:**  
- None directly (template-based inputs include metadata, documentation, and configuration).  

**Output:**  
- A fully structured repository ready for software development, including documentation, license, and workflow templates.
