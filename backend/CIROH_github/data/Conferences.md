# Project Title: **Conferences**

## Project Objective  
The **Conferences** repository serves as a collection space for **conference presentations and posters** produced by the **Alabama Water Institute (AWI)** and the **Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH)**.  
Its purpose is to organize, preserve, and share presentation materials that highlight CIROH’s ongoing research and contributions to hydrologic science and water prediction.

## Core Functionalities  
- Provides a repository for uploading **PDF versions** of slides, posters, and presentations.  
- Represents CIROH and AWI’s participation in scientific and professional conferences.  
- Acts as a centralized archive for communication and outreach materials related to water prediction and hydrology research.  

## Technical Stack  
- **File Format:** PDF (for uploaded slides and posters).  
- **Platform:** GitHub (for storage and sharing).  
- **Technologies Used:** Not specified.  

## Setup and Usage  
No setup or installation instructions are provided. Contributors are expected to upload presentation materials in **PDF format** directly to the repository.  

## Project Context & Domain  
- **Domain:** Hydrology / Scientific communication / Research dissemination.  
- **Affiliation:**  
  - **Alabama Water Institute (AWI)**  
  - **Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH)**  
  - **NOAA–The University of Alabama Partnership**  
- **Purpose:** Share and document research outputs—specifically conference materials—that advance CIROH’s mission to improve water prediction, hydrologic forecasting, and community resilience.  

## Input / Output  
**Input:**  
- Conference presentation slides and posters in PDF format.  

**Output:**
