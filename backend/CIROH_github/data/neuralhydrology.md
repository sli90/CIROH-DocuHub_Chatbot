# Project Title: **neuralhydrology**

## Project Objective  
The **neuralhydrology** project is a Python library for training neural networks with a strong focus on hydrological applications. Its goal is to provide a modular and flexible framework for hydrology-related deep learning research, allowing users to easily integrate new datasets, architectures, and training components through configuration files without modifying the core code.

## Core Functionalities  
- Enables training of neural networks for hydrological modeling.  
- Provides modular design for easy integration of new datasets, model architectures, and training components.  
- Supports configuration-based experimentation to train models without code changes.  
- Built on the PyTorch framework for flexibility in deep learning research.  
- Includes documentation and research blog for user support and updates.  
- Open-source and continuously updated by the AI for Earth Science group at Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria.
