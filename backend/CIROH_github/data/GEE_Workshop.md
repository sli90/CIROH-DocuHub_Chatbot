# Project Title: **GEE_Workshop**

## Project Objective  
The **GEE_Workshop** repository provides instructional materials and code examples for working with Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Python and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to process, analyze, and visualize geospatial data for environmental and Earth science applications.

## Core Functionalities  
- Contains example scripts and notebooks for Google Earth Engine operations.  
- Demonstrates data retrieval, processing, and visualization using GEE.  
- Supports both JavaScript and Python implementations.  
- Includes hands-on exercises for workshop participants.  

## Technical Stack  
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
- **Platform:** Google Earth Engine  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (for Python-based examples)  

## Setup and Usage  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Follow workshop instructions or open provided Jupyter notebooks.  
3. Run scripts using the GEE Code Editor or Python API.  
4. Modify and execute code to explore geospatial datasets and visualization techniques.
