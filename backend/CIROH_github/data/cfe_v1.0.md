# Project Title: **cfe_v1.0**

## Project Objective  
The **Conceptual Functional Equivalent (CFE)** model is a simplified conceptual hydrologic model written by Fred Ogden. It is designed to be functionally equivalent to the National Water Model (NWM). The repository includes both the original authorâ€™s code and a BMI-enabled, expanded version of the model for broader integration and testing.

## Core Functionalities  
- Implements a conceptual model functionally equivalent to the National Water Model.  
- Provides both standalone and framework-integrated operation modes.  
- Includes example configurations demonstrating model coupling and data exchange:  
  - **Example 1:** Standalone mode reading local forcing data.  
  - **Example 2:** Coupled to AORC (provides forcing data via BMI).  
  - **Example 3:** Coupled to AORC and PET modules for evapotranspiration.  
  - **Example 4:** Same as Example 3 but with rootzone-based evapotranspiration.  
  - **Example 5:** NextGen framework mode, coupled to PET module.  
- Offers detailed configuration options for model parameters.  
- Includes unit tests and example datasets for validation.  
- Supports community contributions through GitHub pull requests.  

## Technical Stack  
- **Languages:** C.  
- **Frameworks:** BMI (Basic Model Interface).  
- **Dependencies:** Forcing data (AORC), PET module, and configuration files.  

## Setup and Usage  
- Detailed build and run instructions are provided in the `INSTALL.md` guide.  
- Configuration parameters and model setup details are documented in the `configs/README.md` file.  
- Unit and example test cases are available in the `test/` directory.  
- The model supports both standalone and coupled framework execution modes.  

## Project Context & Domain  
- **Domain:** Hydrology / Hydrologic Modeling.  
- **Affiliation:** NOAA Office of Water Prediction (OWP).  
- **Purpose:** Provide a simplified, functionally equivalent representation of the National Water Model for research and operational evaluation.  

## Input / Output  
**Input:**  
- Forcing data (e.g., from AORC).  
- Model configuration files specifying parameters and settings.  

**Output:**  
- Modeled hydrologic outputs generated by the CFE model.
