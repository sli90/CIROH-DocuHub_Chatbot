# Project Title: **training-NGIAB-101**

## Project Objective  
The **NGIAB 101 Training Module** provides an introductory, hands-on learning experience with **NextGen In A Box (NGIAB)**, a modular, open-source hydrologic modeling framework. Developed by the **Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH)**, the lesson is built using [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/).  
It guides users through installation, data preparation, model execution, evaluation, and visualization, with optional advanced topics for high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

## Core Functionalities  
- Introduces users to the **NextGen In A Box (NGIAB)** modeling framework.  
- Covers the full workflow: installation, data preparation, model execution, evaluation, and visualization.  
- Includes **optional HPC-focused content** for advanced learners.  
- Built using **The Carpentries Workbench**, which provides a modular and reproducible lesson framework.  
- Cites foundational research on NGIAB for academic context.
