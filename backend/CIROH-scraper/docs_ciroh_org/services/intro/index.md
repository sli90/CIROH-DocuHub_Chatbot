## Computing infrastructure access for consortium members and partners

The **CIROH CyberInfrastructure** empowers CIROH consortium members by providing a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly computing platform. We understand the challenges researchers face in managing **computational resources**, and the CIROH CyberInfrastructure alleviates these burdens by offering a suite of pre-configured environments and resources. Our team of engineers and developers meticulously optimizes both **cloud-based** (AWS and Google Cloud) and **on-premise infrastructure** (Pantarhei HPC cluster) to ensure unparalleled flexibility and scalability.

This translates into a powerful platform that includes:

- **Simplified Access:** The CIROH CyberInfrastructure streamlines access to computational environments, eliminating the need for time-consuming installations and maintenance.

- **Unmatched Flexibility:** Our multi-cloud and on-premise infrastructure provides a diverse range of options to suit your specific research needs.

- **Scalable Resources:** The CIROH CyberInfrastrucure readily scales to accommodate your growing data analysis and computational demands.

- **Pre-Installed Software:** Leverage pre-installed hydrological software packages to jumpstart your research endeavors.

- **Streamlined Development:** Benefit from the secure and rapid application development and deployment capabilities offered by Cloud.


The CIROH CyberInfrastructure is meticulously designed to empower CIROH researchers and innovators to achieve groundbreaking results in hydrology. **Join us and unlock the full potential of your research today!**
