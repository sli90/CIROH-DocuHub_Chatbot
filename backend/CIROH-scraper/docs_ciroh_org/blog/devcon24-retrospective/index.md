The CIROH team recently participated in the **2nd Annual CIROH Developers Conference (DevCon24)**, held from May 29th to June 1st,2024. The conference brought together a diverse group of water professionals to exchange knowledge and explore cutting-edge research in the field of hydrological forecasting.

Reflecting CIROH's current research focus, the conference explored topics including hydrological modeling (NextGen), flood inundation mapping, hydroinformatics, social science, and community engagement. Attendees got the opportunity to delve deeper into specific areas through its well-structured training track. This year the tracks were:

- **NextGen**
- **Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM)**
- **Hydrological Applications of Machine Learning (ML)**
- **Hydroinformatics**
- **Cross-cutting**

This year, various workshops leveraged cloud technologies. Notably, we provided access to the 2i2c JupyterHub environment, a cloud-based platform for interactive computing, for ten workshops. This facilitated seamless access to powerful computing resources for participants. Additionally, we provided AWS instances to support four workshops.
