# DocuHub Technologies

Here's a quick look at some of the infrastructure that underpins DocuHub.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a modern static website generator specially tuned to make it easier to maintain and update documentation. Docusaurus forms the core of DocuHub, and is responsible for handling most of the site's content.
