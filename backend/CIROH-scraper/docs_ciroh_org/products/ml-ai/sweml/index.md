## Advancing Snow Modeling

The Snow Water Equivalent Machine Learning (SWEML) is a tool that:

- Incorporates ground-based snow measuring sites
- Uses remotely-sensed snow cover information
- Employs an Artificial Neural Network
- Provides point estimations of Snow Water Equivalent

- Trained on historical data from NASA's ASO missions
- Divided into regions
- Uses LightGradientBoost Model for feature selection
- Includes functions for:
  - Downloading data
  - Pre-processing
  - Running inference
  - Producing visualizations
