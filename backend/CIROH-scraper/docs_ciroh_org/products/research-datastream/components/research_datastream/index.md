The Research DataStream is an array of daily NextGen executions in the AWS cloud. An exciting aspect of the Research DataStream is the NextGen configuration is open-sourced and community editable, which allows any member of the hydrologic community to contribute to improving forecasts. By making the NextGen forcings, outputs, and configuration publicly available, it is now possible to leverage regional expertise and incrementally improve hydrologic forecasts made with the NextGen Framework.

Now generating daily NextGen data! -> [https://datastream.ciroh.org/index.html](https://datastream.ciroh.org/index.html)

The current configuration of the NextGen Research DataStream are public [here](https://datastream.ciroh.org/index.html#realizations/). These files are picked up directly during the NextGen executions in AWS Cloud.

To contribute to this realization file follow these steps.

1. Improve upon parameterization in the VPU realization file
2. Email James Halgren at [jshalgren@ua.edu](mailto:jshalgren@ua.edu) with your updated NextGen configuration
