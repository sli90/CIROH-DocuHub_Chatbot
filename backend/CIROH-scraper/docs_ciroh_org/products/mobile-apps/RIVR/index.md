## Introduction to the CIROH RIVR App [​](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/mobile-apps/RIVR/\#introduction-to-the-ciroh-rivr-app "Direct link to Introduction to the CIROH RIVR App")

Welcome to the RIVR App, your go-to tool for real-time and forecast river flow information. Whether you're a kayaker, fisherman, or hydrologist, RIVR provides critical data to help you plan and understand river conditions. With the RIVR App, you can monitor river levels, access short-term and long-term forecasts, and manage a list of your favorite rivers for quick access.

## Background of the US NWM Streamflow Forecasts [​](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/mobile-apps/RIVR/\#background-of-the-us-nwm-streamflow-forecasts "Direct link to Background of the US NWM Streamflow Forecasts")

The RIVR App utilizes streamflow forecasts generated by the National Water Model (NWM). The NWM is a hydrologic model for the United States that simulates the water cycle, including streamflow, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. By leveraging the NWM, RIVR provides users with up-to-date and scientifically sound river flow predictions.

## Finding Rivers using the Map Interface [​](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/mobile-apps/RIVR/\#finding-rivers-using-the-map-interface "Direct link to Finding Rivers using the Map Interface")

The RIVR App offers a map interface to find river monitoring stations:

1. Upon opening the "Add River" section, you'll see a map with location markers.
2. Zoom in or out to explore different areas.
3. Markers indicate river monitoring stations. Tap on a marker to see more details. You may be able to also search for a place in the search bar, such as "Louisiana".
4. Choose from different map views such as "Streets," "Outdoors," "Light," "Standard," and "Satellite".
5. You will also be able to search by distance or name.

## Viewing Forecasts for a Specific River [​](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/mobile-apps/RIVR/\#viewing-forecasts-for-a-specific-river "Direct link to Viewing Forecasts for a Specific River")

To access detailed forecasts for a river:

1. Select a river from your "My Rivers" list, or choose it from the map interface.
2. You'll be taken to the river's detail page, where you can view current flow, flow status, and forecast information.
3. The river's name and location (e.g., Louisville, Kentucky) will be displayed.
4. Current flow is shown in ft³/s.
5. Flow status (e.g., "Low") indicates the current condition.
6. Return period information is available showing 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year flow benchmarks.
