NextGen In A Box is a community-accessible verison of NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework ( [NextGen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen)).
It simplifies deployment through containerization, which allows the entire NextGen workflow to be run using just a single script.
Additionally, the broader NextGen In A Box ecosystem offers essential tools to improve, validate, and visualize your models at every stage of the process.

### Deployment Options
