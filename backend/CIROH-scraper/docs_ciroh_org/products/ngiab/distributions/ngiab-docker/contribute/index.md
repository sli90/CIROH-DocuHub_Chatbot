Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from everyone, and we want to make the process as easy and transparent as possible.

## Issue tracking

Please check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/issues) for existing issues that you can work on. If you find a new issue or have a feature request, please open a new issue so we can discuss it and prioritize it accordingly.

> Note that in addition to its own reports, the NGIAB-CloudInfra issue tracker currently hosts tickets from CIROH CyberInfrastructure.

## How to contribute

1. If an Issue does not already exist, you can use the [bug report template](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) to create one.

2. Depending on your permissions, create either a fork or a branch of the repository to make changes in.

3. Make your changes and commit them with clear and concise commit messages.

4. Push your changes to the fork/branch.

5. Open a pull request from your fork/branch to the repository with a clear and descriptive title and detailed description of your changes.

6. Once your pull request is submitted, a PR validation CI pipeline will trigger that will validate the changes.

7. Please make sure that the PR pipeline is successful.

8. The maintainers of the repository will merge the PR upon verifying both the validation pipeline results and the contents of the commit.
