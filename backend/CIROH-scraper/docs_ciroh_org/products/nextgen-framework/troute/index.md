troute is a Python package for generating channel networks from digital elevation models (DEMs). It uses a tree-based approach to identify and connect channels, resulting in realistic and hydrologically consistent channel networks.

## Key Features of t-route: [​](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/nextgen-framework/troute/\#key-features-of-t-route "Direct link to Key Features of t-route:")

- Tree-Based Approach: t-route uses a tree-based algorithm to identify and connect channels, ensuring hydrologically consistent channel networks.
- High-Resolution DEMs: t-route can generate channel networks from high-resolution DEMs, capturing detailed channel morphology.
- Flexible and Extensible: t-route provides a flexible framework for customizing the channel generation process and extending its capabilities.
