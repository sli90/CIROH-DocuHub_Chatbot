ngen: Next Generation Water Modeling Engine and Framework Prototype

ngen is a model agnostic framework designed for building and integrating models rather than being a model itself. It focuses on a data-centric process that abstracts the addition of processes and data behind a standard. This design allows for greater flexibility and standardization in model creation and integration.
