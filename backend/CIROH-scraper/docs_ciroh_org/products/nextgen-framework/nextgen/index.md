The Basic Model Interface (BMI) standard employed in the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling (NextGen) framework enables the construction of both mimic and novel model formulations. This involves the ordered execution of modules designed to simulate individual processes or fluxes and the integration of these over time on various control volumes to simulate the temporal evolution of model states. These are referred to as "multi-BMI" formulations.

Currently, the order of execution of modules within a multi-BMI model formulation is determined by the ordering of modules in the run realization file. This presentation showcases model/module developments undertaken to date in this regard and discusses knowledge gaps and needs. Additionally, it proposes potential coding standards for modules that allow for the monitoring of conservation law enforcement at the framework level for different model formulations using various internal discretizations.
