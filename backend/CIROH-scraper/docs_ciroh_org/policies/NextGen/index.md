## Key Points

- NextGen is a model-agnostic, standards-based framework for water resources modeling
- It allows for flexible experimentation with hydrologic cycle representations
- The framework supports explicit coupling of models through sharing of computed states and fluxes
- Design requirements include maximum flexibility, open-source development, and multi-language support
