The Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH) is committed to an open data policy that will maximize the impact and broad use of data and research products produced by CIROH projects and will also ensure that Federal data sharing requirements are met. This policy document is intended to assist CIROH investigators in creating and sharing high-quality data and research products. We begin with guiding principles, after which the specific policy and recommendations are stated. This document also provides guidance and instructions that may be useful to CIROH investigators in meeting the terms of this policy. Finally, we also include an appendix with further details about the specific data sharing requirements of CIROH's partner agencies. We consider this policy to be a living document that will be revised as the needs of CIROH investigators and CIROH partner agencies evolve.
