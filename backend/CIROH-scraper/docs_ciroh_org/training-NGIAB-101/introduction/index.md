## Introduction to NextGen

The U.S. National Water Model (NWM) provides hydrologic predictions for over 2.7 million river reaches across the United States ([Cosgrove et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13184)). **The Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen) is an advancement of the NWM**, setting the stage for a more flexible modeling approach. NextGen promotes model interoperability and standardizes data workflows, allowing the integration of various hydrologic models tailored to specific regional processes, providing key flexibility needed for future success with continental-scale modeling. The NextGen framework continues to undergo testing, improvements, and updates through research efforts at the NOAA Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH).

## What is NGIAB?

Managing NextGen's complex software ecosystem remains challenging. The NextGen framework's implementation requires handling numerous software libraries and dependencies. To streamline this, we developed NextGen In A Box (NGIAB)—an open-source, containerized solution that encapsulates the NextGen framework and essential modeling components into a self-contained, reproducible application. By eliminating manual configuration burdens, NGIAB enables researchers to focus on scientific inquiry rather than software setup and maintenance. Beyond simplifying deployment of the NextGen Framework, NGIAB fosters collaboration among researchers, academic institutions, and government agencies by providing a scalable, community-driven modeling environment. **In essence, NGIAB provides a unified solution that powers NextGen models, including future versions of the NWM starting with version 4.**

### Terminology
- NextGen: overarching framework
- NGIAB: containerized packaging of NextGen
- `ngen`: the engine used within NextGen
- NWM: specific operational implementation used by the National Weather Service

## Containerization

- Containerization addresses compatibility issues and hardware variation challenges by **encapsulating applications, their dependencies, and runtime environments into a single, portable unit**.
- Think of containerization like putting a model and all its tools into a sealed toolbox – you can carry and run it anywhere, and everything needed is inside.
- This ensures consistent execution across diverse computing environments, regardless of differences in hardware or software configurations.
- NGIAB leverages Docker ([Boettiger, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1145/2723872.2723882)) and Singularity ([Hunt et al., 2005](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236160050_An_Overview_of_the_Singularity_Project)) to streamline deployment.

## Architectural Components

NGIAB is designed as a multi-layered containerized tool that encapsulates the NextGen framework and many components relevant to the NWM within a reproducible environment.

![NGIAB Containerization Architecture](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/fig/fig1-1.png)

Figure 1: Architecture of the NGIAB, highlighting its core modeling foundation, CI/CD pipelines, containerized tools and supporting technologies.

Figure 1 illustrates the layered architecture of NGIAB.

- **Layer 1:** At its core (Layer 1) lies a suite of integrated hydrological modeling components and hydrofabric (a geospatial dataset representing hydrologic features like rivers, basins, and connections), designed to work together within the NextGen framework. Hydrologic models in NGIAB are Basic Model Interface (BMI) compliant, meaning that they follow a standard structure and can be swapped in and out for one another.
- **Layer 2:** Layer 1 is wrapped by the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline layer (Layer 2). CI/CD are tools and practices that automate code testing and updates. NGIAB leverages GitHub Actions to ensure automated testing, integration, and deployment capabilities for reproducible workflows.
- **Layer 3:** The NGIAB Containerization layer (Layer 3) provides the containerized environment and essential configuration tools.
- **Layer 4:** The outermost layer (Layer 4), Technologies & Methods, provides broader infrastructure, best practices, and support for deployment across different computing environments (local, cloud, HPC), and facilitates community engagement and contribution.

The architecture emphasizes four key aspects:
- core hydrological modeling framework capabilities,
- simplified access to modeling tools,
- facilitation of rapid development and reliability,
- and integration of supportive tools and practices.

## Extensions of NGIAB

Several extensions of NGIAB are already integrated with NextGen-related tools like [Data Preprocess](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/data-preparation.html), [Tools for Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research (TEEHR)](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/evaluation.html), and [Data Visualizer](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/visualization.html) (Figure 2). These extensions will be discussed in later episodes.

## Example Applications

Steps common to all hydrologic modeling frameworks include data collection and preparation, framework setup and model execution, evaluation, results visualization, and calibration. Researchers can use NGIAB to execute model runs for their basins of interest. _Note that calibration is not yet an integrated capability within NGIAB._ Figures 3 and 4 show examples of how NGIAB and its extensions have been used to simulate streamflow for five years in the Provo River basin.

These metrics assess how closely simulated results match observed data. The Visualizer can also show the performance of the NWM 3.0 compared to the observed time series.

## Why should I use NGIAB?

NGIAB makes **community contribution** possible in research settings by simplifying setup and providing demos, allowing hydrologists and researchers to configure and modify localized water models. Built on open-source code and the `ngen`/BMI foundation, NGIAB allows integration of a hydrology process model into a larger hydrologic simulation framework, allowing a researcher to focus on their area of specific modeling expertise. Its lightweight container size also empowers hydrologists to execute large-scale runs efficiently and reduce computational bottlenecks. By strengthening collaboration across research teams, NGIAB will help drive the evolution of community-scale water modeling and accelerate the transition from academic innovation to real-world operational use.
