# Learner Profiles

We have lots of different kinds of learners and workshops about NGIAB. This page catalogs resources within this training module to help you to find what you need. For all users, the [Key Points summary page](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/key-points.html) and the [Glossary](https://docs.ciroh.org/reference.html) may be useful references.

## General Users

Are you using this training module as a self-teaching tool? Are you working at your own pace? Are you working off of a standard (non-HPC) computer? If so, following the episodes in order is right for you. The [Advanced Topics episode](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/advanced-topics.html) is optional and can be explored if you are interested.

## HPC Users

Are you planning on running NGIAB on an HPC? You can follow the episodes in order, but replace Episode 2: Installation and Setup with the HPC-specific instructions in the [Advanced Topics module](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/advanced-topics.html).

## DevCon 2025 NGIAB Workshop Attendee

Are you joining us for the DevCon 2025 NGIAB workshop? We have prepared two DevCon-specific documents for you.

- [DevCon 2025 Jetstream Instructions](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/devcon25js.html) will walk you through the specific steps we will take in this hands-on workshop.
- [DevCon 2025 Troubleshooting](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/troubleshooting.html) contains useful reference material if you are stuck during the workshop.

**These documents are key, since we will not be following the default episodes exactly as written.**

After the workshop, feel free to explore the rest of this module to learn more about NGIAB!
