## Introduction

### Figure 1
![NGIAB Containerization Architecture](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/fig/fig1-1.png)

**Figure 1:** Architecture of the NGIAB, highlighting its core modeling foundation, CI/CD pipelines, containerized tools and supporting technologies.

*Description:* A concentric circle diagram titled "NGIAB Containerization Architecture." It consists of four nested layers representing different components. At the center is "1. Core Framework" in gray, symbolizing the core hydrological modeling framework. Surrounding it is "2. CI/CD Pipeline" in green, representing tools that facilitate rapid development and reliability. The next layer is "3. NGIAB Containerization" in blue, indicating simplified access to modeling tools. The outermost layer is "4. Technologies & Methods" in dark blue, representing supportive tools and practices. Labels on the left of the diagram describe the increasing level of support from the core outward.

### Figure 2
![NGIAB model execution process](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/fig/fig1-2.png)

**Figure 2:** Workflow of data acquisition, model execution, evaluation, and results visualization.

*Description:* A flowchart diagram showing the NGIAB model execution process. The central box labeled "NGIAB Model Execution" is connected to three components. To the left is a yellow-green box labeled "Data Preprocess," with three subcomponents listed: "GPKG Sub-setting," "Realization," and "Forcing." To the right, two boxes are connected to the center: a purple box labeled "TEEHR Evaluation" and a green box labeled "Data Visualizer." Dashed arrows indicate the flow of data between preprocessing, model execution, and evaluation/visualization.

### Figure 3
![Provo River network and basin boundaries](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/fig/fig1-4.png)

**Figure 3:** Map showing the drainage basin used as our demonstration case, the Provo River near Woodland, UT (Gage-10154200). This view shows the NGIAB interactive preprocessing tool. The highlighted region (light orange area; downstream-most basin in pink) represents the specific study basin, illustrating the river network (blue lines), sub-basins (orange), and surrounding USGS gaging stations (black dots).

### Figure 4
![NextGen in a Box Visualizer web interface](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/fig/fig1-5.png)

**Figure 4:** Map showing the geospatial visualization using the Data Visualizer for a selected outlet point as well as displaying a time series plot between observed (labeled "USGS"; blue line) and simulated (labeled "ngen"; orange line) with the performance metrics (Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and relative bias). These metrics assess how closely simulated results match observed data. The Visualizer can also show the performance of the NWM 3.0 compared to the observed time series.

## Data Preparation

### Figure 1
![USGS National Map](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/fig/fig3-1.png)

**Figure 1:** Map showing an example drainage basin. View from the USGS National Map.

*Description:* A screenshot of the USGS National Map centered on the Provo River network in Utah, showing streamflow and watershed data. A blue map marker identifies a Monitoring Location. A red dot marks an Active Monitoring Location farther downstream. The Upstream Basin is shaded in grey, while Upstream Flowlines and Downstream Flowlines are highlighted in dark and light blue, respectively. A scale bar in the bottom right shows distances of 5 kilometers and 3 miles. A map legend in the lower right corner explains the color codes for flowlines and monitoring locations.

### Figure 2
![Data Preprocess tool view](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/fig/fig1-4.png)

**Figure 2:** Map showing an example drainage basin. View from the Data Preprocess tool. The highlighted region (light orange area; downstream-most basin in pink) represents the specific study basin, illustrating the river network (blue lines), sub-basins (orange), and surrounding USGS gaging stations (black dots).

## Evaluation

### Figure 1
![Hydrograph comparison](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/fig/fig5-1.png)

**Figure 1:** Comparison of the NextGen-based model (labeled "ngen"; blue line) and the NWM time series (labeled "nwm30_retrospective"; orange line) for the same location. The figure is automatically generated by the TEEHR-based analysis that accompanies the `guide.sh` script included with NGIAB and is named `timeseries_plot_streamflow_hourly_inst.html` in the `teehr` folder.

*Description:* A hydrograph spanning years 2017-2022. The x-axis is labeled "Datetime", and the y-axis is labeled "streamflow_hourly inst [m^3/s]". The blue line represents the NextGen run (labeled "ngen"), and the orange line represents the NWM 3.0 time series (labeled "nwm30_retrospective"). A legend is in the upper-right corner explaining the colors of these lines.

## Visualization
