## About NGIAB

NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) is an open-source, containerized solution that encapsulates the NextGen framework and essential modeling components into a self-contained, reproducible application. It simplifies the deployment of the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen), which advances the National Water Model with flexible, modular, and regionally adaptive hydrologic modeling at national scale.

## Key Components

1. **Core Framework**: Integrated hydrological modeling components and hydrofabric
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment capabilities
3. **Containerization**: Docker and Singularity support for portability
4. **Extensions**: Data preprocessing, evaluation (TEEHR), and visualization tools

## Usage

These documents provide comprehensive training materials for:
- Installing and setting up NGIAB
- Preparing data for model runs
- Executing NextGen models
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing results
- Advanced topics including HPC deployment
