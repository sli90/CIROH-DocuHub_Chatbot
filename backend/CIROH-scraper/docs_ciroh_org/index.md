## Loved by Researchers

### Patrick Clemins (April 2025)
> "CIROH's DocuHub allows us at the University of Vermont's NETWA (Northeast Evaluation Testbed for Water Resources Applications) to effectively engage with our community by providing a listing of our services, documentation for how to use them, and an introductory "How to Get Started " page. It also allows us to share our progress and stay engaged with the broader CIROH community so that we can grow our impact as others discover and use our products and services."

### James Halgren (April 2025)
> "Having a community editable common place for sharing code, data resources, and community guidance was one of the critical first steps to being able to gather a community for operational hydrological modeling. Docuhub has begun to fill that gap. I am excited to see it growing and hope it becomes a valuable resource for the CIROH researchers and broader community."

### Supath Dhital (April 2025)
> "DocuHub has transformed my research process. I discovered several hydrological frameworks I wasn't previously aware of when searching for specific tools. The platform not only helps me learn from others' work, but also provides a professional space to document and publish my own research findings. When colleagues ask for my work, sharing a DocuHub link adds credibility and enhances collaboration. It's become an essential tool in my research workflow."

### Gio (April 2025)
> "What I like the most about using DocuHub is that it is easy to contribute to the documentation when I update or want to add my research work. Also, I like the idea that I can contribute with blogs and tutorials depending on the needs of the community."

### Dr. Shahab Alam (April 2025)
> "CIROH DocuHub plays a vital role in supporting researchers by providing a centralized, accessible platform to share tools, documentation, and applications with the broader hydrologic science and forecasting community. Research tools such as the CSES and its Tethys-CSES web app reside on DocuHub, enhancing their visibility and usability. This platform bridges research and practice through transparency and open access, amplifying collaborative impact across the community."

### Quinn Lee (April 2025)
> "I frequently use DocuHub to access documentation and best practices for the computing infrastructure I use for my research."
