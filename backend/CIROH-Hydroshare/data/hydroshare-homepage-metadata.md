## How it works

### 1. **Create data**

[![Create data](https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-prod-static-media/static/img/home-page/step1.cad6c9bc9cf1.png)](https://help.hydroshare.org/hydroshare-resources/content-types/)

Collect your data using the same methods you use now. HydroShare supports a broad set of hydrologic data types.

### 2. **Upload to HydroShare**

[![Upload to HydroShare](https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-prod-static-media/static/img/home-page/step2.0e6606e2e010.png)](https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/creating-resources/)

Upload your data files to HydroShare through the web user interface. HydroShare will automatically extract as much metadata as it can from the files you upload.

### 3. **Describe with metadata**

Use HydroShare's simple metadata entry forms to finish describing your data so that your colleagues can find, access, and interpret it.

### 4. **Share with colleagues**

Choose who has access to the data and models you have uploaded to HydroShare. You can share with individual users or make your resources public for everyone to access.

### 5. **Permanently Publish**

[![Formally Publish](https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-prod-static-media/static/img/home-page/step5.fd555c7a3e62.png)](https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/formally-publishing-data/)
