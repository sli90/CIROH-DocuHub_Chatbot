## Abstract
This resource was first created for a live demo during an online I-GUIDE VCO meeting on May 9, 2023. It was then modified for another live demo during the 1st annual CIROH users and developers conference in Salt Lake City, May 16-18. Recently, it was used for the National Water Center Summer Institute 2023.

It contains codes and inputs for a precipitation analysis across the Logan River Watershed. In this analysis, we will obtain modeled precipitation from two products: AORC and PRISM, compare the basin's average daily precipitation, and save results back to HydroShare.

## Data Sources

### Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC)
The Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) is a gridded record of near-surface weather conditions covering the continental United States and Alaska and their hydrologically contributing areas. It is defined on a latitude/longitude spatial grid with a mesh length of ~800 m (30 arc seconds), and a temporal resolution of one hour. Elements include hourly total precipitation, temperature, specific humidity, terrain-level pressure, downward longwave and shortwave radiation, and west-east and south-north wind components. It spans the period from 1979 at Continental U.S. (CONUS) locations / 1981 in Alaska, to the near-present. This suite of eight variables is sufficient to drive most land-surface and hydrologic models and is used to force the calibration run of the National Water Model (NWM).

### Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM)
The PRISM Climate Data from Oregon State University is a gridded product covering the Conterminous United States. It combines climate observations from a wide range of monitoring networks with sophisticated modeling techniques to establish a local climate-elevation relationship for each grid cell. This dataset spans from 1895 to the present and can be used to analyze short- and long-term climate patterns. The PRISM dataset is available at two distinct spatial scales: a publicly available 4 km version and a more refined 800 m resolution dataset available for a fee.

### Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)
The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a seamless, national hydrologic unit dataset. Hydrologic units represent the area of the landscape that drains to a portion of the stream network. WBD contains eight levels of progressive hydrologic units (HUC) identified by unique 2- to 16-digit codes. The case study region was selected from the HUC 12 watershed boundaries for the Great Basin.

## Case Study Description
The Logan River Watershed is a snowmelt-dominated watershed located in the Bear River mountain range east of Logan, Utah. Most precipitation falls in the form of snowfall during winter months and as rain during spring and summer time. Water flows southwest through mostly natural land cover.

## Research Significance
This resource provides a comprehensive precipitation analysis framework for the Logan River Watershed, demonstrating the integration of multiple precipitation data products (AORC and PRISM) for hydrologic analysis. The included computational notebooks enable researchers to:

- Compare high-resolution precipitation datasets from different sources
- Calculate basin-averaged precipitation values
- Understand spatial and temporal precipitation patterns in snowmelt-dominated watersheds
- Apply similar methodologies to other watersheds

The resource has been used extensively for educational purposes, including demonstrations at major conferences (CIROH DevCon, I-GUIDE VCO) and training institutes (National Water Center Summer Institute), making it a valuable teaching tool for hydrologic data analysis and integration workflows.
