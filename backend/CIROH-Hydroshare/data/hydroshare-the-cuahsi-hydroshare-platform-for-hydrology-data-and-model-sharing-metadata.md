## Abstract
Poster for AGU Fall Meeting, December 11, 2023
https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1336263

HydroShare (http://www.hydroshare.org) is a web-based repository and hydrologic information system operated by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) that enables users to share, collaborate around, and publish data, models, scripts, and applications associated with water related research to meet Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) open data mandates. The HydroShare repository also links with connected computational systems, enabling users to reproducibly run models and analyses and share documented workflows. This presentation will overview the capabilities and best practices developed for collaboration and sharing of data and other research products along with the use of HydroShare and linked computing. It will focus on successes and challenges in engaging scholars, researchers, and practitioners as individuals and as communities, including lessons learned in sharing data across large scientific communities such as the Critical Zone Collaborative Network. It will also include collaboration functions being developed for the Institute for Geospatial Understanding through an Integrative Discovery Environment (I-GUIDE) and Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH), where challenges associated with large scale input/output data preparation, staging, and sub setting along with execution of large-scale models and data are faced.
