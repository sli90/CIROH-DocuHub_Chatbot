## Research Significance
This comprehensive dataset documents high-water marks from two major flooding events in Vermont during 2023, providing critical data for flood science and resilience planning. Key significance includes:

- **Multiple Event Documentation**: Captures data from both summer (July) and winter (December) 2023 flooding events
- **Seasonal Flood Comparison**: Enables analysis of flood characteristics across different seasons and precipitation types
- **Long-term Monitoring Network**: Part of UVM's established floodplain monitoring infrastructure
- **Climate Change Indicators**: Documents increasing flood frequency in Vermont, with two major events in a single year
- **Model Calibration**: Provides ground-truth data for calibrating flood prediction models for different seasonal conditions
- **Risk Assessment**: Supports improved flood risk mapping and emergency preparedness planning
- **Research-to-Operations**: Bridges academic research with operational flood forecasting needs

The 181.1 MB dataset represents one of the most comprehensive flood extent documentations for Vermont's 2023 flood season, critical for understanding how extreme precipitation events impact the region's complex terrain and river systems.
