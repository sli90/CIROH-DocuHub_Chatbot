## Abstract
This collection of resources is was assembled to illustrate ways to use and work with data in HydroShare through its applications programming interface (API), the web application connector resource type, and web services for some content types. The resources collected here are intended to serve as tutorial examples for others to model in creating scripts and tools that act on HydroShare stored data.

## Research Significance
This collection serves as a comprehensive tutorial and reference library for the HydroShare community, demonstrating best practices and capabilities for:

- **API Integration**: Shows practical examples of using the HydroShare Python Client Library (hsclient) for programmatic data access
- **Model Integration**: Includes examples from multiple modeling frameworks including RHESSys, TauDEM, Landlab, and the National Water Model
- **Computational Workflows**: Demonstrates how to link HydroShare resources with JupyterHub computing environments for reproducible research
- **Data Processing Methods**: Provides working examples of terrain analysis, flood inundation mapping, pump test analysis, and watershed delineation
- **Educational Resources**: Serves as teaching materials for hydrology courses and workshops, including HydroLearn content

The collection represents a significant knowledge repository for advancing cyberinfrastructure in hydrology, supporting the NSF SI2-SSI initiative goals of integrating data science, modeling, and analysis in water science research.
