## Abstract
This tutorial introduces the use of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) HydroShare repository and linked CIROH JupyterHub computing platform on 2i2c in support of CIROH collaborative research and NextGen modeling.

Learning Objectives:
- Be able to use JupyterHub computing platforms linked to HydroShare (CIROH JupyterHub on 2i2c specifically) to access, analyze and work with high community value datasets (AORC, Hydrofabric).
- Be able to set up, run, and analyze the results from a NextGEN model configured for research over a small watershed.
- Be able to create a HydroShare resource, populate it with metadata to share with a colleague or make it public.

To do this tutorial download and work through the steps in the Word Document CIROH_HydroShare_Tutorial.docx.

You will need to launch this resource into CIROH JupyterHub using Open With to work with the Tutorial Python and Jupyter Notebook files.

This HydroShare resource provides a tutorial on the use of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) HydroShare repository and linked CIROH JupyterHub computing platform on 2i2c in support of CIROH collaborative research and NextGen modeling. It introduces use of Jupyter Notebooks for retrieval of NOAA Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) datasets and setting up and executing NextGen for a small test watershed as a starting point for research with NextGen.
