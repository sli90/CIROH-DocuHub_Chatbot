## Research Significance
This resource demonstrates the practical application of NOAA's National Water Model for local community resilience planning, specifically focusing on the Long Prairie Watershed in Minnesota. The work provides:

- **Local Application of National Models**: Shows how national-scale models can be downscaled and applied for local decision-making
- **Community Resilience Tools**: Provides practical tools for flood risk assessment and community planning
- **Integrated Analysis Framework**: Combines NWM outputs with StreamStats and local data for comprehensive flood analysis
- **Annual Exceedance Probability Analysis**: Enables communities to understand flood frequencies and plan accordingly
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Includes codes and data that can be adapted for other watersheds and communities

The resource serves as a template for communities seeking to leverage advanced hydrologic models for resilience planning, bridging the gap between national-scale forecasting capabilities and local decision-making needs.
