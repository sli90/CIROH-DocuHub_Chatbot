## Abstract
This repository contains the CUAHSI Summer Institute 2023 results, Theme-1 Nextgen-aridity team. For each CAMELS US basin, we provide the initial parameter configurations (refer to the "config" folder) generated by Dr. Luciana Cunha, and the best-calibrated parameters and streamflow outputs from CFE-classic and CFE-ODE run (refer to the "outputs" folder) generated by the Nextgen-aridity team. The CFE was calibrated for 2000-2009 WY with a 1-year of spin-up using Dynamically Dimensioned Search optimization algorithm (N=500).

Known issue: there were fewer than 10 cases where the baseflow did not converge after a warm-up period of 1 year. We plan to rerun the calibration with an extended warming-up period.

## Research Significance
This resource represents a significant contribution to the NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework development, specifically focusing on the Conceptual Functional Equivalent (CFE) model calibration across CAMELS basins. The work demonstrates:

- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive calibration results comparing CFE-classic and CFE-ODE implementations across diverse hydrologic conditions
- **Parameter Optimization**: Application of the Dynamically Dimensioned Search algorithm for systematic parameter calibration
- **Educational Impact**: Developed during the CUAHSI Summer Institute 2023, serving as a training resource for the next generation of hydrologists
- **Community Contribution**: Provides calibrated parameters that can be used as starting points for further NextGen model development
- **Reproducible Research**: Complete configuration files and outputs enable reproduction and validation of results

The known baseflow convergence issue in fewer than 10 cases highlights the importance of adequate warm-up periods in hydrologic modeling and demonstrates the team's commitment to transparency and continuous improvement.
