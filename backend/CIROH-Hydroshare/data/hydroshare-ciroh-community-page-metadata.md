# HydroShare Community Page: Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH)

## Community Identification
- **Name**: Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH)
- **URL**: https://www.hydroshare.org/community/4/
- **Contact**: ccogswell@cuahsi.org

## Description
CIROH, a partnership between NOAA and The University of Alabama, is a national consortium committed to advancing water prediction – the forecasting of streamflow entering water systems, extreme events such as floods and droughts, and water quality – and building community resilience to water-related challenges. CIROH scientists, from 28 different institutions—academic, government, and private, work to improve the understanding of hydrologic processes, operational hydrologic forecasting techniques and workflows, community water modeling, translation of forecasts to actionable products, and use of water predictions in decision making.

## Community Statistics
- **Total Resources**: 38+ shared resources
- **Resource Types**: Resources, Collections, App Connectors

## Member Groups (8 Groups)
