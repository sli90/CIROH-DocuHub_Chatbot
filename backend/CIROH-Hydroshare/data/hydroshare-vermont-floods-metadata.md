## Abstract
This dataset represents high-water mark observations made following widespread flooding in Vermont on July 10-11, 2024. Sites visited following flood recession are part of a long-term floodplain monitoring and habitat assessment maintained by the University of Vermont. Immediately after the floods, field teams flagged high water marks, took photos, and marked the locations with smart phone GPS. Subsequently a survey team revisited the sites with an RTK-GPS to more precisely capture the location and elevation and post-processed through NOAA's OPUS.

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Field Rating**: Based on initial site visits with confidence levels (Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor)
- **GPS Quality**: Based on RTK-GPS survey quality with detailed criteria in accompanying txt file
