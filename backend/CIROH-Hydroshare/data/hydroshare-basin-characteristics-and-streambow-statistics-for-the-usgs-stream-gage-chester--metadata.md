## Research Significance
This resource provides comprehensive hydrologic data for Chester Creek watershed in Anchorage, Alaska, serving multiple research and management purposes:

- **Urban Hydrology Studies**: Chester Creek flows through urban Anchorage, making this dataset valuable for studying urban watershed dynamics
- **Peak Flow Analysis**: Contains 58 years of streamflow data (1966-2024) enabling robust statistical analysis of flood frequencies and peak flows
- **Climate Change Impacts**: Long-term data record supports analysis of changing hydrologic patterns in Alaska
- **Educational Resource**: Created during the National Water Center Summer Institute 2024, serving as a teaching example for data access and sharing workflows
- **StreamStats Demonstration**: Showcases the integration of USGS StreamStats data with HydroShare for improved data accessibility

The resource demonstrates best practices for documenting and sharing hydrologic data, including comprehensive metadata, multiple data formats (CSV, shapefiles, PDFs, images), and web service endpoints for programmatic access. The inclusion of both raw data and processed reports makes this resource suitable for various user groups, from researchers requiring detailed datasets to managers needing summary statistics.

The watershed's location in Alaska provides valuable data for understanding cold-region hydrology and the impacts of urbanization in northern climates.
