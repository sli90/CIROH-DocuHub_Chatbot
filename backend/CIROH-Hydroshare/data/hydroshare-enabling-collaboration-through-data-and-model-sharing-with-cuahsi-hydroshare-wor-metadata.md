## Research Significance
This workshop resource from the 2024 CIROH Developers Conference represents critical training and capacity building for the hydrologic modeling community. Key contributions include:

- **Hands-on Training**: Provides practical workshop materials for using HydroShare within the CIROH ecosystem
- **Integration with Operational Models**: Demonstrates connections with the National Water Model (NWM) and Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM)
- **Collaborative Infrastructure**: Teaches best practices for data and model sharing across institutions
- **Developer Focus**: Tailored specifically for the CIROH developer community to advance technical capabilities
- **Portal Integration**: Shows how HydroShare resources integrate with the CIROH data portal

The workshop materials serve as both educational resources and documentation of the evolving cyberinfrastructure supporting CIROH's mission to advance research-to-operations in hydrology, fostering collaboration between research institutions and operational forecasting centers.
