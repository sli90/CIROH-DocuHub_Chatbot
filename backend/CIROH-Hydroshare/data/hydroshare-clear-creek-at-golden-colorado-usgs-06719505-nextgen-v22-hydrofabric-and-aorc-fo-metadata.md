## Abstract
Clear Creek at Golden, Colorado (USGS 06719505) is a small, high-elevation, snow-dominated headwater basin on Colorado's Front Range that has been used as a pilot basin for modeling studies at the Colorado School of Mines (see: https://github.com/mines-ciroh/clear_creek_demo) In addition to its proximity to the Mines campus, Clear Creek at Golden, CO is also one of approximately 200 study basins in NOAA Office of Water Prediction's (OWP) Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS) testbed. This resource contains key model inputs to run NOAA's Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (Nextgen) across Clear Creek. These data include 1) a geopackage containing the Clear Creek Nextgen v2.2 hydrofabric, with layers that describe the catchments, flowpaths, attributes, and more; and 2) the 1979-2024 retrospective AORC v1.1 forcings mapped to the Clear Creek v2.2 hydrofabric catchments in Nextgen-compliant netCDF format.
