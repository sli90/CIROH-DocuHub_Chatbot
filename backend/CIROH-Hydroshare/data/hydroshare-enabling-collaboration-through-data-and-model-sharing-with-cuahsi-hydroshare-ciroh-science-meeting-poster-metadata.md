## Abstract
Collaboration is central to CIROH (https://ciroh.ua.edu/). Advancing the knowledge needed to support research to operations in hydrology depends on collaboration around model and data sharing. It requires open data supporting the integration of information from multiple sources; easy to use, generally accessible, shareable computing; and working together as a team and community. The CUAHSI HydroShare platform was developed to advance water research by enabling communities of researchers to more easily and freely share digital products resulting from their research, not just the scientific publications summarizing a study, but the data, models and workflows used to produce the results, consistent with Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles of present-day research. This project advances HydroShare as a platform for CIROH collaborative research and education. The objectives are to (1) enhance community data access; (2) establish interoperability with scalable computing; (3) demonstrate computational reproducibility; and (4) establish and grow a CIROH Community on HydroShare. Work to date has, through a survey, identified high value datasets and developed Jupyter Notebooks to enhance accessing and working with this data. The HydroShare interoperability software stack has been added to CIROH 2i2c JupyterHub to enable execution of these Notebooks. A community of 5 HydroShare groups has been established to facilitate data sharing among CIROH themes. Ongoing efforts focus on providing access to computing resources enabling broader use of the NextGen modeling framework being used to develop future versions of the National Water Model.
