## Abstract
Data compilations of bankfull downstream hydraulic geometry for alluvial rivers, lidar derived high-resolution spatial series of bankfull width for 67 sites, and hydrograph metrics for sites with USGS hydrographs. This compilation is composed of three datasets: (1) a compilation of alluvial river geometry at bankfull for a variety of hydraulic attributes; (2) x, y, and z coordinates of channel bank lines for a selection of sites and their associated river widths derived from high-resolution lidar topography; and (3) statistics describing the hydrographs for a subset of the larger compilation. These data are divided into two primary sets, the larger compilation and a smaller set of sites where the bankfull width was derived from lidar topography. For the high-resolution dataset, the data are available as the coordinates of the bank lines, spatial series of distance downstream and bankfull width, and the spatial series filtered for quality.

## Research Significance
This comprehensive dataset provides critical information for understanding alluvial river channel dynamics and width variability across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The combination of traditional hydraulic geometry measurements with high-resolution lidar-derived channel dimensions offers unprecedented detail for:

- **River Channel Morphology Studies**: Understanding relationships between channel width, discharge, and other hydraulic parameters
- **Climate and Weather Impact Analysis**: Separating long-term climate influences from short-term weather effects on river channel geometry
- **Hydraulic Modeling**: Providing ground-truth data for calibration and validation of river hydraulic models
- **Geomorphological Research**: Investigating controls on channel width variability in alluvial systems
- **Water Resources Management**: Supporting flood risk assessment and river restoration planning

The extensive spatial coverage (67 sites with high-resolution data) and temporal range (1980-2024) make this dataset particularly valuable for understanding how alluvial rivers respond to environmental perturbations across different scales.
