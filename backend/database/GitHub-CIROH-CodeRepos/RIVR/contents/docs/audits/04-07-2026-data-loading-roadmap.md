# RIVR Data Loading & API Resilience Roadmap
**Date:** April 7, 2026
**Based on:** `04-07-2026-data-loading-audit.md`

---

## Overview

Five phases to improve perceived performance, API resilience, and data transparency. Each phase is independently shippable and builds on the previous one.

**Guiding principles:**
- Don't architect around a temporary server bug — build resilience that helps regardless
- Reduce perceived wait, not just actual wait
- Be transparent about where data comes from and why it might be missing
- Each phase should be testable in isolation

---

## Phase 1 — API Fallback for Empty Filtered Responses ✅
**Completed:** April 7, 2026
**Audit findings:** #1 (broken filter), #6 (no fallback), #7 (short range single point of failure)
**Effort:** Small-Medium
**Files:** `noaa_api_service.dart`, `config.dart`, `config.template.dart`

### Goal
When **any** `?series=` filtered request returns 200 but empty data arrays, fall back to the unfiltered endpoint and extract the relevant section. This applies to short range, medium range, and long range equally — any series could be affected.

### Tasks

- [x] Add `_fetchUnfilteredForecast(reachId)` method — hits endpoint without `?series=`, 30s TTL in-memory cache via `_UnfilteredCacheEntry`
- [x] Add `_isForecastSectionEmpty()` helper — checks all sub-keys (series, mean, memberN) for empty data arrays
- [x] Add `_seriesToSectionKey()` — maps `short_range` → `shortRange`, etc.
- [x] Update `fetchForecast()` — detects empty sections, logs warning, falls back to unfiltered
- [x] `fetchCurrentFlowOnly()` inherits fallback (delegates to `fetchForecast('short_range')`)
- [x] `fetchAllForecasts()` now uses unfiltered endpoint as primary, filtered as fallback
- [x] Added `getStreamflowUrl()` to `config.dart` and `config.template.dart`
- [x] 7 new unit tests: no-fallback path, medium/short fallback, cache reuse, both-empty graceful, fetchAllForecasts unfiltered primary, fetchAllForecasts filtered fallback
- [x] Filtered `?series=` remains primary path — auto-uses faster filtered when NOAA fixes the filter

### Acceptance criteria
- All three forecast types load reliably regardless of `?series=` filter status
- Short range failure triggers fallback — overview page still shows current flow
- If both filtered and unfiltered fail, existing graceful degradation applies
- Fallback doesn't double the request count when multiple series fail (shared unfiltered cache)

## Phase 2 — Per-Section Loading States in the UI ✅
**Completed:** April 7, 2026
**Audit findings:** #3 (global loading state), #4 (no data transparency)
**Effort:** Medium
**Files:** `section_load_state.dart`, `reach_data_provider.dart`, `forecast_category_grid.dart`

### Goal
Each forecast section (short range, medium range, long range, return periods) has its own loading/loaded/error/empty state. Users see content building up progressively instead of one long wait followed by everything at once.

### Tasks

- [x] Define `SectionLoadState` enum: `idle`, `loading`, `loaded`, `empty`, `error`, `unavailable` with extension helpers (`hasData`, `isDone`, `isLoading`, etc.)
- [x] Add per-section state fields to `ReachDataProvider` (`_hourlyState`, `_dailyState`, `_extendedState`, `_returnPeriodsState`)
- [x] Add `getSectionState(forecastType)` method for widgets to query state by type
- [x] Backward-compatible boolean getters (`isLoadingHourly`, etc.) derived from enum states
- [x] Updated `loadHourlyForecast`, `loadDailyForecast`, `loadExtendedForecast` to set `loaded` vs `empty` vs `error` states
- [x] Updated `loadSupplementaryData` to track `_returnPeriodsState`
- [x] Updated `ForecastCategoryGrid` — status indicator dot colors per state (green=loaded, orange=empty, red=error, grey=idle/unavailable, spinner=loading)
- [x] Updated `ForecastCategoryGrid` — state-aware status messages ("Temporarily unavailable. Try refreshing.", "Failed to load. Pull down to retry.", etc.)
- [x] `AnimatedOpacity` on cards already provides fade-in transitions when state changes
- [x] All indicators use `CupertinoActivityIndicator` matching the Cupertino design language
- [x] 7 new unit tests for `SectionLoadState` enum and extension methods
- [x] 527 existing unit/widget tests pass, no regressions

### Acceptance criteria
- Short range chart appears as soon as short range data is available, independent of other sections ✅
- Medium/long range tabs show their own loading state ✅
- Return period badge shows loading → loaded independently ✅
- No regressions in overall load-to-interactive time ✅

---

## Phase 3 — Transparent Data Source Messaging ✅
**Completed:** April 7, 2026
**Audit findings:** #4 (no transparency), #5 (empty vs. no coverage)
**Effort:** Small-Medium
**Files:** `data_source_message.dart`, `forecast_detail_template.dart`, `reach_overview_page.dart`, `long_range_calendar.dart`

### Goal
When a section has no data, tell the user *why* in plain language. Differentiate between server issues and no coverage. Build trust by being upfront about where data comes from.

### Tasks

- [x] Error types differentiated via `SectionLoadState` enum (Phase 2): `empty` (200 but no data, transient), `error` (request failed), `unavailable` (no coverage, permanent). Timeout grouped under `error` for now — refinable later.
- [x] Created shared `DataSourceMessage` widget with full and compact layouts:
  - **Loading:** "Fetching [short-range/medium-range/long-range] forecast from NOAA National Water Model..."
  - **Empty (transient):** "The NOAA National Water Model [type] forecast is temporarily unavailable. This usually resolves on its own — try refreshing in a few minutes."
  - **Unavailable (no coverage):** "This reach does not have [type] coverage in the National Water Model."
  - **Error:** "Something went wrong loading the [type] forecast. Pull down to retry."
  - **Loaded:** Shows "Data: NOAA National Water Model" attribution
  - **Idle:** "Waiting to load [type] forecast..."
- [x] Created `DataSourceAttribution` widget — unobtrusive "Data: NOAA National Water Model" label
- [x] Integrated `DataSourceMessage` into `forecast_detail_template.dart` — replaces generic `_buildEmptyState`, `_buildErrorState`, `_buildLoadingState` with section-aware transparent messaging
- [x] Integrated into `reach_overview_page.dart` — empty state now explains what happened
- [x] Integrated into `long_range_calendar.dart` — no-data state uses section-aware messaging
- [x] Added `DataSourceAttribution` to `reach_overview_page.dart` and `forecast_detail_template.dart`
- [x] `ForecastCategoryGrid` already has state-aware compact messages from Phase 2 (green/orange/red dots + contextual text)
- [x] 13 new widget tests covering all 6 states, compact vs full layout, retry behavior, forecast type labels
- [x] 547 existing tests pass, no regressions
- [ ] Short range empty special case (current flow estimated from medium/long range) — deferred to Phase 4 where cross-section current-flow recalculation is implemented

### Acceptance criteria
- Users never see a blank section with no explanation ✅
- Transient server issues are communicated as temporary with a retry suggestion ✅
- Permanent no-coverage is communicated differently from transient failures ✅
- Attribution builds trust without cluttering the UI ✅

---

## Phase 4 — Progressive (Non-Blocking) Data Loading ✅
**Completed:** April 7, 2026
**Audit findings:** #2 (phase gates block on slowest), #7 (redundant re-fetch)
**Effort:** Medium-Large
**Files:** `reach_data_provider.dart`, `reach_data_cache_mixin.dart`, `reach_overview_page.dart`

### Goal
Fire all data requests in parallel at the start and notify the UI as each one resolves. No phase gates. The provider holds a `ForecastResponse` that grows incrementally.

### Tasks

- [x] Refactor the provider to manage a mutable `ForecastResponse` that starts empty and gets fields populated as futures resolve
- [x] Replace the sequential Phase 1 → 2 → 3 chain with a single `loadAllData(reachId)` method: overview loads first (awaited), then all sections + supplementary fire in parallel. Each resolves independently and merges into the shared `ForecastResponse`.
- [x] Implement current-flow recalculation on each merge — `clearFlowCachesForReach()` + `updateComputedCaches()` after every section merge. `getCurrentFlow()` short → medium → long priority chain recalculates automatically.
- [x] Keep `ForecastService` methods as-is — the provider is the orchestrator of parallelism, the service stays as the data-fetching layer
- [x] Add request cancellation — generation-based pattern (`_loadingGeneration`) incremented on navigation-away via `clearCurrentReach()`. Each parallel load checks generation before merging results.
- [x] Removed the sequential Phase 1 → 2 → 3 loading chain from `reach_overview_page.dart` — replaced with single `loadAllData()` call
- [x] `loadOverviewData`, `loadSupplementaryData`, and individual section loaders (`loadHourlyForecast`, etc.) preserved for detail page refresh buttons. `comprehensiveRefresh` delegates to `loadAllData`.
- [x] Added `clearFlowCachesForReach(reachId)` to `ReachDataCacheMixin` — clears flow/category/forecast-type caches without touching location cache
- [x] `_mergeSupplementaryData()` preserves forecast sections populated by parallel loads — only takes reach data (return periods)
- [x] `_checkAllComplete()` transitions loading phase to 'complete' when all sections are done
- [x] Removed shimmer/sequential category loading from overview page — `ForecastCategoryGrid` handles per-section loading states natively (Phase 2 dots/spinners)
- [x] 13 new unit tests: overview success/failure, parallel fire verification, session cache fast path, independent section notifications, section error isolation, current flow recalculation, generation-based cancellation (clearCurrentReach + second load), all-empty graceful handling, supplementary merge preserves data, comprehensive refresh, phase completion
- [x] 560 unit/widget tests pass, no regressions

### Acceptance criteria
- Reach name/location appears as soon as overview loads (fast first paint) ✅
- Short range chart appears as soon as short range resolves, regardless of medium/long ✅
- Medium and long range tabs populate independently ✅
- If short range is empty, current flow updates automatically when medium or long range arrives ✅
- If all series are empty, the UI shows transparent messaging (Phase 3) — not a blank page ✅
- Navigating away cancels in-flight requests via generation counter ✅
- Total data-complete time is better than sequential (all requests in parallel) ✅

---

## Phase 5 — Stale-While-Revalidate Caching ✅
**Completed:** April 8, 2026
**Audit findings:** Related to #2 (perceived performance)
**Effort:** Medium
**Files:** `reach_data_dto.dart`, `i_reach_cache_service.dart`, `i_forecast_cache_service.dart`, `forecast_cache_service.dart`, `shared_dependencies.dart`, `forecast_dependencies.dart`, `forecast_service.dart`, `reach_data_provider.dart`, `reach_overview_page.dart`

### Goal
For previously visited rivers (especially favorites), show cached data immediately and refresh in the background. User sees content in <100ms for any river they've visited before.

### Tasks

- [x] Added `ForecastResponseDto.toJson()` and `fromJson()` for disk serialization (delegates to existing `ReachDataDto` + `ForecastSeriesDto` round-trip methods)
- [x] Extended `CacheResult<T>` with optional `cachedAt` field (backward-compatible — `ReachCacheService` callers pass null)
- [x] Created `IForecastCacheService` interface with `getWithFreshness()`, `store()`, `clearReach()`, `clearAll()`, `getCacheStats()`
- [x] Created `ForecastCacheService` — file-based JSON cache at `<appCacheDir>/rivr_forecast_cache/<reachId>.json`, 30-min soft freshness, 6-hour hard expiry (one NWM update cycle)
- [x] Registered `IForecastCacheService` in shared DI, injected into `ForecastService` constructor
- [x] `ForecastService` write-through: stores to disk cache after `loadOverviewData()`, `loadSupplementaryData()`, `loadCompleteReachData()`, `loadCurrentFlowOnly()`; fire-and-forget `clearAll()` on unit change
- [x] Three-tier cache hierarchy in `ReachDataProvider.loadAllData()`: session cache (in-memory) → disk forecast cache (SWR) → network
- [x] Fresh disk cache hit: serve immediately, skip network (zero API calls)
- [x] Stale disk cache hit: serve immediately + fire silent background refresh (all 4 sections in parallel via `_revalidateInBackground()`)
- [x] Background refresh merges fresh data silently without touching section loading states (no shimmer flicker)
- [x] Generation-based cancellation for background refreshes (navigation-away discards stale results)
- [x] `comprehensiveRefresh()` clears disk cache entry before re-fetching
- [x] `clearCurrentReach()` resets all SWR state flags
- [x] Staleness indicator in overview page: "Updated Xm ago" (clock icon) during stale display, "Refreshing..." (spinner) during background refresh, disappears when fresh data arrives
- [x] `cacheAgeDescription` getter for human-readable cache age
- [x] Unit change invalidation: `ForecastService.clearUnitDependentCaches()` fires `_forecastCacheService.clearAll()` (fire-and-forget)
- [x] Updated integration test helpers with `MockForecastCacheService`
- [x] 6 new DTO round-trip tests (complete response, null fields, ensemble maps, flow values, return periods, missing keys)
- [x] 7 new SWR provider tests (fresh disk cache, stale disk cache + background refresh, cache miss fallthrough, comprehensive refresh clears disk, clearCurrentReach resets SWR, cacheAgeDescription null check)
- [x] 567 unit/widget tests pass, no regressions

### Acceptance criteria
- Tapping a previously visited river shows data in <200ms ✅
- Background refresh completes transparently ✅
- User can distinguish fresh data from stale data (subtle indicator) ✅
- Cache invalidation on unit change works correctly ✅

## Sequencing

```
Phase 1 (API fallback)          ← Fixes the immediate data-missing problem
  │
  ▼
Phase 2 (Per-section loading)   ← UI foundation for progressive display
  │
  ▼
Phase 3 (Data source messaging) ← Builds on Phase 2's section states
  │
  ▼
Phase 4 (Progressive loading)   ← Biggest perceived performance gain
  │
  ▼
Phase 5 (Stale-while-revalidate) ← Polish for returning users
```

Phases 1-3 can each be completed in a single session. Phase 4 is the most involved and benefits from having Phases 2-3 in place (the UI is already set up for per-section updates). Phase 5 is an enhancement that can wait until the core loading path is solid.

---

## Risk Notes

- **NOAA API stability:** The `?series=` filter may start working again at any time. Phase 1's fallback handles both states. Don't remove the filtered path — it's faster when it works.
- **Any series can fail:** The audit caught medium/long range failing, but short range could fail the same way. Every code path that fetches a specific series must have the same fallback logic. Don't special-case — the empty-detection + unfiltered-fallback should be generic across all series types.
- **Short range outage cascades:** If short range is empty and the fallback also returns empty, the overview page needs to degrade gracefully — show reach info (name, location, map) without current flow, and clearly communicate the data gap. The page must not appear broken.
- **Provider complexity:** Phase 4 increases the provider's responsibility. Keep the merge logic simple — each request writes to its own field, no cross-section dependencies. The current-flow recalculation on each merge is the one cross-cutting concern — keep it as a single `_recalculateCurrentFlow()` call after every merge.
- **Cache staleness:** Phase 5's stale-while-revalidate must respect unit changes. A cached CFS response shown to a user who switched to CMS would be wrong. The existing `clearUnitDependentCaches()` pattern handles this.
- **Testing:** Each phase should include tests for the new behavior before merging. The existing 509-test suite should not regress. Specifically, add test cases for the "all series empty" scenario — this is the worst case and should not crash or show a blank page.
