**Date:** March 2026
**Testers:** Bryce Imel, Phebe Ramsdell, Henok Teklu, Xueyi Li, and internal team

## Bugs

- [x] **Push notifications not being received** — Testers have not received any push notifications even when their favorited rivers display risk levels different than Normal. Notifications should be triggering but are not arriving on device. -- Fixed: added retry logic with exponential backoff, cache-first return period strategy, batch-fetching to deduplicate API calls across users, `Promise.allSettled` for resilient parallel fetching, and client-side fixes (write `notificationFrequency` on enable, setup tap-to-navigate listeners immediately). **NOTE: The NWM API key in `functions/.env` was revoked after accidental exposure. Ben Lee (CIROH) will provide a new key — update `functions/.env` with the new key and redeploy Cloud Functions (`firebase deploy --only functions --force`) before notifications will work.**
- [x] **Music playback stops on app launch** — Opening the app kills any background audio (e.g., music). Root cause: `VideoPlayerController.play()` activates the OS audio session in exclusive mode, stealing audio focus even though videos are muted with `setVolume(0.0)`. *(Bryce Imel)* -- Fixed: pass `VideoPlayerOptions(mixWithOthers: true)` to `VideoPlayerController.asset()` so video playback shares the audio session instead of claiming exclusive focus.
- [x] **Forecast page intermittent loading failure** — Occasionally need to refresh multiple times to get a river's forecast page to load. *(Bryce Imel)* -- Fixed: added automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 2 retries) for all NOAA API calls on timeout or 5xx errors, increased quick timeout from 10s to 15s, and eliminated redundant parallel reach info fetches in `loadSpecificForecast` that caused entire operations to fail if either request timed out.
- [x] **"Share My Location" button does nothing** — Tapping the button produces no visible response or action. *(Xueyi Li)* -- Fixed: added iPad `sharePositionOrigin` for share popover, delayed share dialog until action sheet dismissal animation completes, and added user-facing error feedback.
- [x] **Video backgrounds only play on one card on Android** — When multiple favorite cards are visible, only the first card's video plays on Android; the rest show the gradient fallback. Root cause: each card creates its own `VideoPlayerController` decoding a 1280x720 (720p) video, but Android devices have only 3-6 hardware `MediaCodec` decoder slots. Additional players silently fail. *(Internal testing)* -- Fixed: downscaled all 6 source videos from 1280x720 to 480x270 (~88% file size reduction, ~20MB to ~2.4MB total), stagger card video initialization by 100ms per card index to avoid overwhelming decoder pool, and added `mixWithOthers: true` to prevent audio session conflicts.
- [ ] **Verification email links arrive expired** — Every "Resend Verification Email" results in an already-invalid/expired link by the time it is opened. *(Henok Teklu)*
- [ ] **Verification emails land in Spam** — Verification emails are consistently filtered to Spam folders. *(Henok Teklu)*
- [x] **Intro tutorial tooltip renders off-screen** — One of the onboarding tutorial messages displays above the screen bounds, cut off and unreadable. It should be repositioned below the widget it points to so it stays within the screen bounding box. *(Xueyi Li / internal team)* -- Fixed: changed Pull to Refresh tooltip from ContentAlign.top to ContentAlign.bottom.
- [x] **Error banners persist across route changes** — Error messages (e.g., "Invalid sign-in credentials") remain visible after navigating from Login to Create Account. Banners should clear on route change. *(Henok Teklu)* -- Fixed: AuthWrapper now calls `clearMessages()` when switching between auth pages.
- [x] **Premature "Signed in successfully" banner** — After tapping "Create Account", the app shows a success banner even though the user is still blocked by the email verification screen and not actually signed in yet. *(Henok Teklu)* -- Fixed: removed success banners from `signIn()` and `register()` in AuthProvider since both immediately transition to authenticated/verification views.

## UX Improvements

- [x] **Email validation too permissive** — The frontend shows a green checkmark for malformed emails (e.g., emails with internal spaces like `enock37. @gmail.com`, or long random strings). Implement stricter regex validation. *(Henok Teklu)* -- Fixed: extracted shared `validateEmail()` with HTML5-spec regex (rejects spaces, short TLDs, consecutive dots). Applied to login, register, and forgot password pages.
- [x] **Rename "Copy Reach Info" to "Copy Info"** — The word "reach" is confusing to non-technical users. Simplify the label. *(Phebe Ramsdell)* -- Fixed: renamed to "Copy Info".
- [x] **Empty favorites screen guidance for new users** — When a new user opens the app for the first time, the home screen shows an empty favorites list with no guidance. The helpful guide that appears after adding a favorite should be shown from the start, before any favorites are added. *(Xueyi Li)* -- Fixed: replaced vague description and help dialog with clear inline CTA pointing to the + button.
- [x] **Clarify the "Wave" section's purpose** — The Wave view on the Hourly Timeline feels redundant given the "View Hourly Hydrograph" button below it. Consider adding interactivity (tap data points to see specific values) to differentiate it, or reconsider its role. *(Xueyi Li)* -- Resolved: removed the Wave view and Cards/Wave toggle entirely. The hourly timeline now shows only the hour cards view, which provides more useful at-a-glance data than the wave visualization.
- [x] **Add a back/home route for navigation edge cases** — Ensure there is a root "Welcome" or "Landing" route so users are not forced out of the app when navigating back. *(Henok Teklu)* -- Fixed: added `PopScope` to FavoritesPage with double-back-to-exit pattern (press back once shows "Press back again to exit" hint, press again within 2 seconds to exit). Also blocked back navigation from auth screens since there's no meaningful screen behind them.

## Feature Requests

- [x] **Add to favorites from Flow Forecast Overview Page** — Users should be able to favorite a river directly from the forecast detail view, not only from the map. *(Internal team)* -- Fixed: added heart icon button next to river name in station header. Shows outline/filled state via FavoritesProvider, uses optimized addFavoriteWithKnownCoordinates.
- [x] **Option to restore default water video on favorite cards** — Users who customize their favorite card background should be able to revert to the original water animation. *(Bryce Imel)* -- Already implemented: ImageSelectionPage shows a "Flow animation" button when a custom image is set, which calls `_resetToDefault()` to restore the original water video background.

## Design Decisions

- [x] **Discontinue Dark Mode** — Dark mode does not render well in several views. To reduce complexity in future releases, dark mode/theme support will be removed entirely. *(Internal team decision)* -- Completed: removed ThemeProvider, ThemeService, theme settings page, all brightness conditionals. App locked to light theme.
