# Forcing Processor
Forcingprocessor converts National Water Model (NWM) forcing data into Next Generation National Water Model (NextGen) forcing data. This tool provides the forcing pre-processing for the [NextGen Research DataStream](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream).

The motivation for this tool is NWM data is gridded and stored within netCDFs for each forecast hour. Ngen inputs this same forcing data, but in the format of catchment averaged data time series data.

## Install UV
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
## Create a Python Virtual Environment
```
uv venv
```
## Install Requirements
```
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```
## Create Output Directory
```
mkdir -p data/forcing
```
## Run the Forcingprocessor
```
uv run python src/forcingprocessor/processor.py ./configs/conf_fp.json
```
Prior to executing the processor, the user will need to obtain a geopackage file to define the spatial domain. The user will define the time domain by generating the forcing filenames for `processor.py` via `nwm_filenames_generator.py`, which is explained [here](#nwm_file). Note that `forcingprocessor` will calcuate weights if not found within the geopackage file.

### Channel Routing Data Extraction

This tool can also extract `q_lateral` data from the NWM's channel routing data sources. This is
helpful for experimenting with routing simulations. Note that channel routing data extraction
cannot be run at the same time as forcing data extraction at this time. This use case requires a
mapping file ending in `map.json` in the format
```
{ngen-nex-id-1: [nwm-id-1-1,...],
.
.
.
ngen-nex-id-k: [nwm-id-k-1,...]}
```
where the list of `nwm-id`s are the NHD reaches associated with that NextGen hydrofabric nexus.

## Example `conf.json`
```
{
    "forcing"  : {
        "nwm_file"     : "",
        "gpkg_file"    : ""
    },

    "storage":{
        "output_path"      : "",
        "output_file_type" : []
    },

    "run" : {
        "verbose"       : true,
        "collect_stats" : true,
        "nprocs"        : 2
    },

    "plot":{
        "nts"        : 24,
        "ngen_vars"  : [
            "DLWRF_surface",
            "APCP_surface",
            "precip_rate",
            "TMP_2maboveground"
        ]
    }
}
```

## nwm_file
A text file given to forcingprocessor that contains each nwm forcing file name. These can be URLs or local paths. This file can be generated with the [nwmurl tool](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/nwmurl) and a [generator script](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/forcingprocessor/blob/main/src/forcingprocessor/nwm_filenames_generator.py) has been provided within this repo. The config argument accepts an s3 URL.
 ```
 python nwm_filenames_generator.py conf_nwm_files.json
 ```
 An example configuration file:
 ```
 {
    "forcing_type" : "operational_archive",
    "start_date"   : "202310300000",
    "end_date"     : "202310300000",
    "runinput"     : 1,
    "varinput"     : 5,
    "geoinput"     : 1,
    "meminput"     : 0,
    "urlbaseinput" : 7,
    "fcst_cycle"   : [0],
    "lead_time"    : [1]
}
 ```

## Weights
To calculate NextGen forcings, "weights" must be calculated to extract polygon averaged data from gridded data. The weights are made up of two parts, the `cell_id` and `coverage`. These are calculated via [exactextract](https://github.com/isciences/exactextract) within [weights_hf2ds.py](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/forcingprocessor/blob/main/src/forcingprocessor/weights_hf2ds.py), which is optionally called from forcingprocessor.

If a geopackage is supplied to forcingprocessor, it will be searched for the layer `forcings-weights`. If this layer is found, these weights are used during processing. If not, forcingprocessor will call [weights_hf2ds.py](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/forcingprocessor/blob/main/src/forcingprocessor/weights_hf2ds.py) to calculate the weights (cell_id and coverage) for every divide-id in the geopackage. This can take time, so forcingprocessor will write a parquet of weights out in the metadata, that can be reused in future forcingprocessor executions.

Example of direct call
```
python3 forcingprocessor/src/forcingprocessor/weights_hf2ds.py \
--outname ./weights.parquet \
--input_file ./nextgen_VPU_03W.gpkg
```
