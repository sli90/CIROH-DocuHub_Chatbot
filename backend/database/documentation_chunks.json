That's why Song et al. 2024 developed δHBV2.0, a cutting-edge hydrologic model. It's built with high-resolution modeling of physics to deliver seamless, highly accurate streamflow simulations, even down to individual sub-basins. It's already proven to be a major improvement, performing better than older tools at about 4,000 measurement sites. We also provide a comprehensive 40-year water dataset for ~180,000 river reaches to support this."

But here's a common hurdle: making powerful scientific tools like this easy and reliable for everyone to use within a larger framework can be tough. Setup issues, runtime errors, and inconsistent results can frustrate users.\n\nNGIAB stepped in to solve exactly this problem. Team has taken the complexity out of using the operations-ready models within NextGen by creating one unified, reliable package. Thanks to NGIAB, users don't have to worry about tricky setups or whether the model will run correctly. NGIAB ensures that our models are compatible everywhere and, most importantly, that they run exactly as designed, consistently and faithfully, every single time, no babysitting required. This means users get the full power of our advanced modeling, without the headaches."

There are three different flavors of forecasts: short, medium, and long range.\n\n- Just like how your local weather station can tell you what the weather will be like tomorrow, in 3 days, or a week from now; the NWM can tell you what the stream flow will be like in 18 hours, 10 days, or even up to 30 days from now.\n\n- NOAA Central Library Seminar Recording from OWP (Next-Generation Water Resources Modeling): [https://youtu.be/DLIi3PruYxo](https://youtu.be/DLIi3PruYxo)"

This involves the ordered execution of modules designed to simulate individual processes or fluxes and the integration of these over time on various control volumes to simulate the temporal evolution of model states. These are referred to as \"multi-BMI\" formulations.\n\nCurrently, the order of execution of modules within a multi-BMI model formulation is determined by the ordering of modules in the run realization file. This presentation showcases model/module developments undertaken to date in this regard and discusses knowledge gaps and needs. Additionally, it proposes potential coding standards for modules that allow for the monitoring of conservation law enforcement at the framework level for different model formulations using various internal discretizations."

This tool can be used to evaluate any hydrological model that uses NHDPlus dataset. It allows a user to evaluate the performance of a hydrological model at the collocated USGS gauges and NHDPlus stream reaches. This Python-based tool helps visualize the results and investigate the model performance interactively. The current version of the tool is available on GitHub and can be accessed using the following link.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n>  Below content is rendered from [https://github.com/CIROH-UA/Community-Streamflow-Evaluation-System/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/Community-Streamflow-Evaluation-System/blob/main/README.md).\n\n[![Github_top](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33735397/206313977-e67ba652-3340-4a1b-b1d1-141d8d5001f2.PNG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33735397/206313977-e67ba652-3340-4a1b-b1d1-141d8d5001f2.PNG)"

    "content": "## Application Overview National-scale streamflow modeling remains a modern challenge, as changes in the underlying hydrology from land use and land cover (LULC) change, anthropogentic streamflow modification, and general process components (reach length, hydrogeophysical processes, precipitation, temperature, etc) greatly influence hydrological modeling. In a changing climate, there is a need to anticipate flood intensity, impacts of groundwater depletion on streamflow, western mountain low-flow events, eastern rain-on-snow events, storm-induced flooding, and other severe environmental problems that challenge the management of water resources. Given the National Water Model (NWM) bridges the gap between the spatially coarse USGS streamflow observations by providing a near-continuous 2.7 million reach predictions of streamflow using the standardized NHDPlus framework, there lies the potential to improve upon the capabilities of the model by characterizing predictive performance across the heterogeneity of processes and land covers present at the national scale. The python-based Community-Streamflow-Evaluation-System package provides a foundation to evaluate national hydrography dataset (nhd) based model outputs with colocated USGS/NWIS streamflow monitoring stations (parameter: 060) without the need to download in-situ or NWM v2.1 data (NWM v3.0 coming soon!)."

By using Community-Streamflow-Evaluation-System, researchers can identify locations where a model may benefit from further training/calibration/parameterization or a need for new model processes/features (e.g., integration of reservoir release operations) to ultimately create new post-processing methods and/or hydrological modeling formulations to improve streamflow prediction capabilities with respect to modeling needs (e.g., stormflow, supply, emergency management, flooding, etc)."

It is a terrain-based fluvial flooding model that uses model-predicted streamflow and reach-averaged Synthetic Rating Curves (SRCs) to generate inundation extent and depth rasters at HUC-8 scale (Hydrologic Unit Code-8). The model can produce FIMs for all order streams within the watershed at a very low computational cost. This notebook streamline the FIM generation process or the OWP HAND-FIM framework on the cloud. It allow users to run over mutiple HUC-8s simultaneously. This model can run using any temporal resolution available from the input streamflow data (hourly, daily, monthly etc). ### **Currently we are hosting the FIM-4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 version for Inundation Mapping.**"

The evaluation of flood maps from different sources using geospatial platforms can be tedious and requires repeated processing and analysis for each map. These preprocessing steps include extracting the correct flood extent, assigning the same projection system to all the maps, categorizing the maps as binary flood maps, removal of permanent water bodies, etc. This manual data processing is cumbersome and prone to human error.\n\nTo address these issues, we developed Flood Inundation Mapping Prediction Evaluation Framework (FIMeval), a Python-based FIM evaluation framework capable of automatically evaluating flood maps from different sources. FIMeval takes the advantage of comparing multiple target datasets with large benchmark datasets. It includes an option to incorporate permanent waterbodies as non-flood pixels with a user input file or pre-set dataset. In addition to traditional evaluation metrics, it can also compare the number of buildings inundated using a user input file or a pre-set dataset."

These models are combined according to external configuration files, which ensures that all\nmodel runs are highly portable and reproducible.\n\nAs of version 3.0 of the National Water Model, which was adopted in 2024, the NWM represents a specific configuration\nof the NextGen Framework, which is freely available for use by the scientific community.\n\n> _Source: [The National Water Model, NOAA-OWP](https://www.weather.gov/media/owp/oh/docs/2021-OWP-NWM-NextGen-Framework.pdf)_"

This subset is output as a geopackage (.gpkg).\n2. Calculates **forcings** as a weighted mean of the gridded NWM or AORC forcings.

Although TEEHR's outputs can be displayed within the Data Visualizer, this tool is primarily designed to provide a broad overview of model results. Users seeking TEEHR's more advanced analysis features can still access them outside the Data Visualizer.\n\nOne of the advantages of the `viewOnTethys.sh` script is that it allows the user to keep multiple outputs for the same hydrofabric. It prompts the user if they want to use the same output directory by renaming it and adding it to the collection of outputs or if they want to overwrite it.\n\n```\n  ⚠ ~/ngiab_visualizer is not empty.\n  → Keep (K) or Fresh start (F)?

NGIAB solves this problem via containerization.\n\n> For a more detailed summary, click here: [https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/ngiab/intro/what-is](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/ngiab/intro/what-is)"

Compared to traditional virtual machines, which act as standalone units, containers save on storage and memory by sharing key components of the operating system between containers.\n\nThese containers also come with two other benefits: they offer a consistent environment through which software can be run, and they can be easily be reproduced from \"image\" files, which save the container's state in its entirety. NGIAB takes advantage of these states by containerizing the NextGen framework, entirely mitigating its difficult setup process."

This simplifies access management and eliminates the need for storing long-lived credentials.\n\n- **Regularly review and update permissions:** Regularly review and update user and role permissions within subaccounts to ensure they remain aligned with their current needs.\n\n- **Utilize git-secrets**: git-secrets is a client tool that prohibits unwanted commits containing secret data such as API keys, passwords, and tokens. You can integrate it into your CI/CD pipelines to prevent sensitive information from being added to your GitHub repositories. For more information, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/scan-git-repositories-for-sensitive-information-and-security-issues-by-using-git-secrets.html) and the [git-secrets GitHub repository](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets).\n\n- **Use AWS Secrets Manager**: Use AWS Secrets Manager, or other secrets management solution, so you don't have to hardcode keys in plaintext. The application or client can then retrieve secrets when needed. For more information, see [What is AWS Secrets Manager?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html)"

This allows for better cost allocation, resource identification, and easier filtering when managing resources across multiple accounts. Follow [How to tag resources on AWS](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/services/cloudservices/aws/tagging).\n\n- **Cost allocation**: Allowed limit for **new** subaccount is $500/project per month. Monitor the usage throughout the month and if it reaches above $500/project, notify admin of the subaccount to take necessary actions. For projects expecting more than $500 per month usage, please email [ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu](mailto:ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu) in advance to get the approval from higher management. **Effective Sept 2024**, we transitioned to a new budgeting model (for existing\nusers) that provides your CIROH AWS subaccount with a $10,000 budget for\nevery 6-month period and monthly max limit of $3000. This change will give\nyou more flexibility to plan and execute your research workloads without the\nconstraints of a monthly cap.\n\n- **Resource quotas:** Set resource quotas for subaccounts to limit their spending and resource usage. This helps prevent accidental overspending and ensures efficient resource allocation.\n\n- **Monitor resource usage:** Encourage subaccount admins to monitor their resource usage regularly to identify potential cost optimization opportunities."

Deploying resources in the same region as your data minimizes data transfer costs and latency, leading to improved performance and cost-efficiency.\n\n- **Region Selection:** Carefully evaluate the available AWS regions and select the one that best aligns with your data residency requirements, compliance needs, and desired performance characteristics.\n\nEBS:\n\n- **EBS Volume Management: Avoiding Unnecessary Costs:** Terminate EBS Volumes with Terminated Instances: When terminating an EC2 instance, ensure that you also delete any associated EBS volumes that are no longer needed. EBS volumes incur charges even if they are not attached to a running instance.\n\n- **Regularly Review EBS Volume Usage:** Periodically review your EBS volumes using the EC2 Management Console or AWS CLI. Identify any unattached volumes that are no longer required and delete them to avoid ongoing charges.\n\nEFS:\n\n- **Data Lifecycle Management:** Evaluate your data access patterns. For infrequently accessed files, consider migrating data from Amazon EFS to Amazon S3 to leverage its cost-efficient storage classes, such as S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier.\n\n- **Tiered Storage Strategy:** Implement a tiered storage strategy where frequently accessed data resides on EFS for high performance, while infrequently accessed or archival data is moved to S3 for cost-effective long-term storage."

Utilizing Slurm, a user initiates a request for resources and submits a job to a designated queue. Subsequently, the system undertakes the task of extracting jobs from the queues, assigning the requisite compute nodes, and executing the submitted tasks. Although users typically access the Slurm job scheduler by SSH-ing to a Pantarhei login node, it is imperative to emphasize that the recommended practice entails utilizing Slurm to submit work as a job, as opposed to executing computationally intensive tasks directly on a login node. Given that all users share the login nodes, running anything beyond minimal test jobs can adversely affect the collective ability of users to effectively utilize Pantarhei resources."

Dedicated sets of queues are allocated for CPU, GPU, and FPGA nodes, with typically shorter walltime and smaller job size limits translating to expedited turnaround times. Several additional considerations regarding Pantarhei queues merit attention:\n\n1. Pantarhei facilitates shared jobs, whereby multiple tasks can be executed on a single node. This approach enhances job throughput, maximizes overall system utilization, and fosters increased user accessibility to Pantarhei resources.\n2. Pantarhei accommodates long-running jobs, with run times extendable up to seven days for tasks utilizing up to 6 full nodes.\n3. The maximum permissible job size on Pantarhei is 240 cores. For tasks exceeding this threshold, users are advised to initiate a consulting ticket to engage in further discussion with Pantarhei support personnel."

CIROH is responsible for implementing these conditions and ensuring that they are also met by CIROH sub-recipients and subcontractors. The [Data Management Plan](https://docs.ciroh.org/assets/files/CIROH_Data_Management_Plan-0dc8c6f27a387855880c325c7bb02ff1.pdf) submitted with the original CIROH proposal is included as an Appendix to this document.\n\nThe specific wording included in the CIROH Cooperative Agreement is as follows: - **Data Sharing:** Environmental data collected or created under this Grant, Cooperative Agreement, or Contract must be made publicly visible and accessible in a timely manner, free of charge or at minimal cost that is no more than the cost of distribution to the user, except where limited by law, regulation, policy, or national security requirements. Data are to be made available in a form that would permit further analysis or reuse: data must be encoded in a machine-readable format, preferably using existing open format standards; data must be sufficiently documented, preferably using open metadata standards, to enable users to independently read and understand the data. The location (internet address) of the data should be included in the final report."

That's why Song et al. 2024 developed δHBV2.0, a cutting-edge hydrologic model. It's built with high-resolution modeling of physics to deliver seamless, highly accurate streamflow simulations, even down to individual sub-basins. It's already proven to be a major improvement, performing better than older tools at about 4,000 measurement sites. We also provide a comprehensive 40-year water dataset for ~180,000 river reaches to support this.\n\nPenn State research group pushed δHBV2.0 further, training it with even more detailed river data and integrating other trusted models, aiming to make it a key part of the NextGen national water modeling system (as a potential NWM3.0 successor). But here's a common hurdle: making powerful scientific tools like this easy and reliable for everyone to use within a larger framework can be tough.

The conference brought together a diverse group of water professionals to exchange knowledge and explore cutting-edge research in the field of hydrological forecasting.\n\nReflecting CIROH's current research focus, the conference explored topics including hydrological modeling (NextGen), flood inundation mapping, hydroinformatics, social science, and community engagement. Attendees got the opportunity to delve deeper into specific areas through its well-structured training track. This year the tracks were:\n\n- **NextGen**\n- **Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM)**\n- **Hydrological Applications of Machine Learning (ML)**\n- **Hydroinformatics**\n- **Cross-cutting**\n\nThis year, various workshops leveraged cloud technologies. Notably, we provided access to the 2i2c JupyterHub environment, a cloud-based platform for interactive computing, for ten workshops. This facilitated seamless access to powerful computing resources for participants. Additionally, we provided AWS instances to support four workshops.\n\n![DevCon2024](https://docs.ciroh.org/img/blog/2024-05-devcon24/devcon24_04.JPG)"
