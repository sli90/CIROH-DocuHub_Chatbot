    "The output you generate will be stored in a PostgreSQL database to power a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Specifically, your response will populate a `JSONB` field. The `summary_text` within your JSON response will be used to create a 3072-dimension vector embedding for semantic search. Therefore, the summary must be information-dense, conceptually accurate, and optimized to be found by user queries about CIROH's products, services, policies, and research activities.\n",

    "1.  **Focus on \"What\" and \"Why\"**: The `summary_text` should clearly identify the page's core purpose. Is it a product description, a tutorial, a policy document, a release note, or a blog post?\n",
    "2.  **Extract Named Entities**: The `entities` array must include all specific names of products, services, tools, technologies, standards, or key collaborators mentioned (e.g., \"NextGen in A Box\", \"Research Datastream\", \"Hydrofabric\", \"NOAA\", \"BYU Hydroinformatics Courses\").\n",
    "3.  **Capture Key Concepts**: The `keywords` array should capture the main technical or thematic concepts, not just proper nouns (e.g., \"hydrologic modeling\", \"flood inundation mapping\", \"water quality\", \"data management\", \"cloud computing\", \"machine learning\").\n",
    "4.  **Synthesize, Don't Quote**: Do not copy sentences directly from the text. Synthesize the information in your own words to create a coherent and semantically rich summary.\n",
    "5.  **Be Dense and Direct**: Start the summary directly with the subject. Avoid introductory phrases. For example, instead of writing \"This page describes NextGen In A Box...\", you must write \"NextGen In A Box is a community-accessible...\". Be direct and objective.\n",
